# Multi-View Consistency Learning: Complete Implementation

## üéØ What is Multi-View Consistency Learning?

**The Problem**: JUMP images have 5 different fluorescent channels showing the SAME cells
- Channel 1 (Alexa 647): Golgi, PM
- Channel 2 (Alexa 568): ER, AGP, Mito  
- Channel 3 (Alexa 488 long): RNA
- Channel 4 (Alexa 488): Actin, ER, Mito
- Channel 5 (Hoechst): Nuclei

**Standard Approach**: Average all channels ‚Üí train on averaged images  
**Problem**: Loses channel-specific information, doesn't explicitly learn invariance

**Multi-View Approach**: Treat channels as different views of same cell
- Global view 1: Average of all channels (complete information)
- Global view 2: Random single channel (channel-specific)
- DINO loss enforces: features(view1) ‚âà features(view2)

**Result**: Model explicitly learns "same cell, different channel" = channel-invariant features!

---

## üî¨ How It Works

### The Multi-View DINO Training Loop

```
For each field of view:
  
  Load: [ch1.tiff, ch2.tiff, ch3.tiff, ch4.tiff, ch5.tiff]
  
  Global Crop 1:
    img_avg = average(ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4, ch5)
    crop1 = random_crop_and_augment(img_avg)
    features1 = student(crop1)
  
  Global Crop 2:
    ch_rand = random_choice([ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4, ch5])
    crop2 = random_crop_and_augment(ch_rand)  
    features2 = student(crop2)
  
  DINO Loss:
    loss = cross_entropy(features1, teacher(crop1)) + 
           cross_entropy(features2, teacher(crop2))
    
    # Since crop1 and crop2 show same cells, this enforces:
    # "Learn same representation regardless of channel!"
  
  iBOT Loss:
    # Similarly applied to both views
  
  KoLeo Loss:
    # Regularization on features
```

### Why This is Powerful

**Explicit Invariance**:
- Model MUST learn features that work for both averaged and single channels
- Cannot just memorize channel-specific patterns
- Forces learning of fundamental "cell-ness"

**Better than Averaging**:
- Averaging: Implicit channel fusion
- Multi-view: Explicit channel invariance learning
- Multi-view should generalize better to unseen channels!

**Example**:
- If model sees Ch1 nuclei and average(all channels) ‚Üí "same cell"
- If model sees Ch2 ER and average(all channels) ‚Üí "same cell"  
- If model sees Ch5 DNA and average(all channels) ‚Üí "same cell"
- Result: Model learns "cell identity" independent of channel!

## üìÅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Multi-View Data Augmentation
**File**: `dinov3/dinov3/data/augmentations_multichannel.py`

**Key Class**: `MultiChannelDataAugmentationDINO`

```python
class MultiChannelDataAugmentationDINO:
    def __call__(self, image_channels):
        # image_channels: [ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4, ch5] (list of PIL Images)
        
        # Global crop 1: Average all channels
        img_avg = average_channels(image_channels)
        crop1 = augment(crop(img_avg))
        
        # Global crop 2: Random single channel
        img_single = random.choice(image_channels)
        crop2 = augment(crop(img_single))
        
        # Local crops: Random channels
        local_crops = []
        for _ in range(8):
            img = random_choice_or_average(image_channels)
            local_crops.append(augment(crop(img)))
        
        return {
            'global_crops': [crop1, crop2],
            'local_crops': local_crops,
            ...
        }
```

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Handles list of channel images
- ‚úÖ Creates averaged view + single channel view
- ‚úÖ Random channel selection for diversity
- ‚úÖ Compatible with standard DINOv3 training loop

### 2. Multi-View Dataset Loader
**File**: `dinov3/dinov3/data/datasets/jump_cellpainting_multiview.py`

**Key Classes**:
- `JUMPMultiViewDecoder`: Returns list of PIL Images (one per channel)
- `JUMPCellPaintingMultiView`: Dataset that discovers and loads all channels

```python
class JUMPCellPaintingMultiView(ExtendedVisionDataset):
    def __getitem__(self, index):
        # Returns list of channel images
        channel_paths = self.fields[index]  # [path_ch1, path_ch2, ...]
        
        channels = []
        for path in channel_paths[:5]:  # 5 fluorescent channels
            img = load_and_preprocess(path)  # Applies CLAHE
            channels.append(PIL.Image.fromarray(img))
        
        # Returns list for multi-view augmentation
        return channels, target
```

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Auto-discovers 3M fields across 6 batches
- ‚úÖ Groups channels by field of view
- ‚úÖ Applies CLAHE to each channel
- ‚úÖ Returns list for multi-view augmentation

### 3. Training Configuration
**File**: `training/configs/dinov3_vits8_jump_multiview.yaml`

**Key Settings**:
```yaml
student:
  patch_size: 8  # Higher resolution
  pretrained_weights: vits16.pth  # Continue training

train:
  dataset_path: JUMPCellPaintingMultiView:root=...
  use_multichannel_augmentation: true  # Enable multi-view

crops:
  num_channels: 5
  channel_selection_mode: random

optim:
  lr: 5.0e-5  # 1/10 for continued training
  epochs: 90  # Slightly longer for multi-view
```

### 4. Integration with SSL Training

The multi-channel augmentation integrates seamlessly:

```python
# In SSLMetaArch.build_data_augmentation_dino():
if cfg.train.get('use_multichannel_augmentation', False):
    from dinov3.data.augmentations_multichannel import create_multichannel_augmentation
    return create_multichannel_augmentation(cfg)
else:
    return DataAugmentationDINO(...)  # Standard augmentation
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### Option 1: Simple Launch (Recommended)

```bash
cd DINOCell/training

# Create launch script for multi-view
./launch_pretraining_multiview.sh
```

I'll create this script for you below.

### Option 2: Manual Launch

```bash
cd dinov3

# Download checkpoint if not already
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dinov3/dinov3_vits16/dinov3_vits16_pretrain_lvd1689m-08c60483.pth \
    -O checkpoints/dinov3_vits16_pretrain_lvd1689m-08c60483.pth

# Launch multi-view training
PYTHONPATH=. python dinov3/train/train.py \
    --config-file ../DINOCell/training/configs/dinov3_vits8_jump_multiview.yaml \
    --output-dir ../DINOCell/checkpoints/dinov3_vits8_jump_multiview
```

## üìä Comparison: Averaging vs Multi-View

| Aspect | Channel Averaging | Multi-View Consistency |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Complexity** | Simple | Moderate |
| **Training Time** | 24-36 hours | 30-40 hours |
| **Channel Info** | Implicit (averaged) | Explicit (separated) |
| **Invariance** | Learned indirectly | Enforced by loss |
| **Implementation** | Standard DINOv3 | Custom augmentation |
| **Expected Performance** | Good | Better |
| **Best For** | Quick experiments | Production models |

### When to Use Each

**Use Averaging** (Option 1) if:
- ‚úÖ Want fastest results (24-36hrs)
- ‚úÖ Simpler to debug
- ‚úÖ Standard DINOv3 pipeline
- ‚úÖ Good enough for most cases

**Use Multi-View** (Option 2) if:
- ‚úÖ Want best possible performance
- ‚úÖ Have 30-40 hours available
- ‚úÖ Need explicit channel invariance
- ‚úÖ Planning to deploy across all channels

**My Recommendation**:
- Start with averaging to get baseline (24-36hrs)
- Then try multi-view to see improvement (30-40hrs)  
- Compare both on your downstream tasks

## üéì Technical Details

### How DINO Enforces Consistency

**Standard DINO** (single image):
```
img ‚Üí crop1, crop2 (different spatial crops)
student(crop1) ‚âà teacher(crop2)  # Same image, different crops
```

**Multi-View DINO** (multi-channel):
```
[ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4, ch5] ‚Üí 
    crop1 = avg(channels)  # Complete view
    crop2 = random(channel)  # Partial view

student(crop1) ‚âà teacher(crop2)  # SAME CELL, different channels!
```

### The Magic

**What the model learns**:
- "This averaged image and this single-channel image are the same cell"
- "Features should be similar regardless of channel"
- "Cell identity transcends imaging modality"

**Result**: Channel-invariant cell representations!

### Comparison with Contrastive Learning

**SimCLR/MoCo** would use:
```
positive pair = (crop1_ch1, crop2_ch3)  # Same cell, diff channels
negative pairs = other cells
```

**Multi-View DINO** uses:
```
teacher-student consistency on:
  view1 = averaged channels
  view2 = random channel
No negative pairs needed!
```

**Advantage**: DINO is more stable and effective for this use case.

## üîß Advanced Configuration Options

### Channel Selection Strategies

**In config**: `crops.channel_selection_mode`

```yaml
# Option A: Pure Random (Recommended)
channel_selection_mode: random
# Global crop 2: Uniformly random from 5 channels
# Local crops: 70% random single, 30% average

# Option B: Sequential
channel_selection_mode: sequential  
# Cycles through channels deterministically

# Option C: Weighted Random
channel_selection_mode: weighted
channel_weights: [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]  # Equal
# Or emphasize certain channels:
# channel_weights: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.6]  # Emphasize nuclei
```

### Augmentation Intensity

**For microscopy**, you may want to reduce augmentation:

```yaml
crops:
  global_crops_scale: [0.5, 1.0]  # Less aggressive cropping
  
# In augmentation code, reduce color jitter:
ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.05)  # Gentler
```

## üìà Expected Benefits

### Quantitative Predictions

**Hypothesis** (to be validated):

| Metric | Vanilla DINOv3 | JUMP-Avg | JUMP-MultiView |
|--------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| **Channel 1 SEG** | Baseline | +5% | +10% |
| **Channel 2 SEG** | Baseline | +5% | +10% |
| **Cross-Channel** | Baseline | +8% | +15% |
| **Zero-Shot** | Baseline | +7% | +12% |

**Reasoning**:
- Multi-view explicitly learns channel invariance
- Should generalize better to unseen channels
- Should work better when channels are mixed/missing

### Qualitative Benefits

‚úÖ **Channel Robustness**: Works if some channels are missing  
‚úÖ **Better Generalization**: Transfers across imaging modalities  
‚úÖ **Unified Representation**: Single model for all channels  
‚úÖ **Research Contribution**: Novel application of multi-view learning  

---

## üß™ Validation Experiments

After pretraining, validate with:

### Experiment 1: Channel Consistency

```python
# Extract features from same cell in different channels
features_ch1 = model.forward(cell_ch1_image)
features_ch2 = model.forward(cell_ch2_image)
features_avg = model.forward(cell_averaged_image)

# Compute similarity
sim_1_2 = cosine_similarity(features_ch1, features_ch2)
sim_1_avg = cosine_similarity(features_ch1, features_avg)
sim_2_avg = cosine_similarity(features_ch2, features_avg)

# Expected for good multi-view learning:
# sim_1_2 > 0.8  (channels are similar)
# sim_1_avg > 0.9  (channel close to average)
# sim_2_avg > 0.9  (channel close to average)
```

### Experiment 2: Cross-Channel Retrieval

```python
# Given a cell in Ch1, retrieve it from Ch2 database
query = cell_image_ch1
database = all_cells_ch2

features_query = model(query)
features_db = model(database)

# Find nearest neighbor
similarities = cosine_similarity(features_query, features_db)
top1 = argmax(similarities)

# Expected: top1 == same cell (high retrieval accuracy)
```

### Experiment 3: Missing Channel Robustness

```python
# Test segmentation with different channel combinations
results_ch1_only = segment_with_dinocell(images_ch1)
results_ch2_only = segment_with_dinocell(images_ch2)
results_all_channels = segment_with_dinocell(images_averaged)

# Expected: Similar performance across all
# Multi-view should have lower variance than averaging
```

        return create_multichannel_augmentation(cfg)
    else:
        # Standard augmentation
        return DataAugmentationDINO(...)
```

---

## üöÄ Launch Multi-View Training

### Quick Start

```bash
cd DINOCell/training

# Launch multi-view pretraining
./launch_pretraining_multiview.sh
```

### What Happens

1. **Loads**: Pretrained ViT-S/16 checkpoint
2. **Adapts**: To patch-8 and multi-view augmentation

# ‚úÖ ibot_loss stable (no NaN)
# ‚úÖ koleo_loss negative (feature diversity)
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Comparison

### Standard Averaging Config

```yaml
train:
  dataset_path: JUMPCellPainting:...  # Single averaged image
  batch_size_per_gpu: 48

crops:
  # Standard settings
```

### Multi-View Config

```yaml
train:
  dataset_path: JUMPCellPaintingMultiView:...  # List of channels
  use_multichannel_augmentation: true  # ‚Üê Key difference!
  batch_size_per_gpu: 40  # Slightly lower

crops:
  num_channels: 5  # ‚Üê Multi-view specific
  channel_selection_mode: random  # ‚Üê Multi-view specific
```

---

## üéØ After Training: Using Multi-View Features

### Extract Channel-Invariant Features

```python
import torch
from dinov3.hub.backbones import dinov3_vits16

# Load your multi-view pretrained backbone
model = dinov3_vits16(
    pretrained=False,
    patch_size=8  # Match training
)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('dinov3_vits8_jump_multiview.pth'))

# Extract features from any channel
img_ch1 = load_image_channel1(...)
img_ch5 = load_image_channel5(...)

features_ch1 = model(img_ch1)
features_ch5 = model(img_ch5)

# Should be similar because multi-view training!
similarity = cosine_similarity(features_ch1, features_ch5)
print(f"Channel 1 vs Channel 5 similarity: {similarity:.3f}")
# Expected: > 0.85 (high similarity for same cell)
```

### Fine-Tune DINOCell Per Channel

```bash
# The backbone is now channel-invariant!
# Fine-tune separate heads for different modalities:

# Nuclei segmentation (Ch5)
python train.py \
    --dataset ../datasets/JUMP_nuclei \
    --backbone-weights ../checkpoints/dinov3_vits8_jump_multiview.pth \
    --freeze-backbone

# ER segmentation (Ch2/Ch4)
python train.py \
    --dataset ../datasets/JUMP_ER \
    --backbone-weights ../checkpoints/dinov3_vits8_jump_multiview.pth \
    --freeze-backbone

# All perform well because backbone is channel-invariant!
```

---

## üí° Advanced: Custom Channel Strategies

### Strategy 1: Nucleus-Centric

Emphasize nuclei channel (Ch5 - Hoechst):

```yaml
# In custom config
crops:
  channel_selection_mode: weighted
  channel_weights: [0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.40]  # 40% nuclei
```

### Strategy 2: All-Channels Ensemble

Use all 5 channels as global crops:

```python
# Modify augmentation to create 5 global crops (one per channel)
# Each paired with teacher
# More compute but maximum channel coverage
```

### Strategy 3: Brightfield + Fluorescent

Include brightfield as additional view:

```python
# Global crop 1: Avg fluorescent (ch1-5)
# Global crop 2: Random fluorescent
# Global crop 3: Middle brightfield (ch7)
# Learn: fluorescent ‚âà brightfield (challenging but powerful!)
```

---

## üìà Expected Training Metrics

### Healthy Multi-View Training

```
Iteration 1000:
  dino_local_crops_loss: 7.8
  dino_global_crops_loss: 7.5
  koleo_loss: -0.28
  ibot_loss: 8.9
  
Iteration 30000:
  dino_local_crops_loss: 4.2  # Should be lower than averaging!
  dino_global_crops_loss: 3.9  # Better consistency
  koleo_loss: -0.35
  ibot_loss: 5.5
  
Final:
  dino_local_crops_loss: ~3.5  # Lower = better channel consistency!
  dino_global_crops_loss: ~3.2
```

**Key Indicator**: DINO losses should converge lower than averaging approach because the model explicitly learns channel consistency!

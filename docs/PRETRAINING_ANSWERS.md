# DINOv3 Pretraining on JUMP: Your Questions Answered

## ❓ Your Questions

### Q1: Which model should I use for 3M images with only 24-48hrs on A100?

**Answer: ViT-Small with Patch-8**

**Reasoning**:
- ✅ **ViT-Small** (21M params) is perfect for 3M images
- ✅ **Patch-8** gives you 4x more patches = higher resolution (784 vs 196 patches per 224×224 image)
- ✅ Fits comfortably in 24-48 hours when continuing from checkpoint
- ❌ **ViT-Base** would be too slow (needs 72-96 hours on single A100)
- ❌ **ViT-Large** impossible in your timeline
- ⚠️ **From scratch** would need 1-2 weeks - NOT recommended

**GPU Memory with Patch-8**:
- ViT-S/8: ~40-50GB with batch size 48 ✅ (fits in A100 80GB)
- ViT-B/8: ~70-80GB with batch size 32 ⚠️ (tight fit)

### Q2: Should I continue from their checkpoint or train from scratch?

**Answer: Definitely CONTINUE from checkpoint!**

**Comparison**:

| Approach | Time to Converge | Final Performance | Your Timeline |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **From Scratch** | 200-300 hours | Baseline | ❌ Impossible |
| **Continue Training** | 24-48 hours | Better (transfer learning) | ✅ Perfect fit |

**Evidence from GitHub**:
> "I recommend starting from the ViT-L configuration... training with a 1/10 of the LR" - baldassarreFe (DINOv3 team)

> "training from scratch with domain-specific dataset performed better than fine-tuning" - BUT this was with longer training time

**For your 24-48hr constraint**: Continue training is the ONLY viable option.

### Q3: How to handle multi-channel images (5 fluorescent + 3 brightfield)?

**Answer: Average fluorescent channels for pretraining, then fine-tune per-channel**

**Your brilliant insight** is correct:
> "because they're the same cells just different things about the cells"

**Implementation Strategy**:

**Phase 1: SSL Pretraining (24-48hrs)**
```python
# Average 5 fluorescent channels → single grayscale → RGB
img_avg = np.mean([ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4, ch5], axis=0)
img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img_avg, CV_GRAY2RGB)
# Train DINOv3 SSL on this
```

**Benefit**: Model learns general "cell-ness" across all channels

**Phase 2: Fine-Tune Per-Channel (2hrs each)**
```bash
# Then fine-tune DINOCell's distance map head separately for each:
- Channel 1 (Alexa 647) → dinocell_ch1.pt
- Channel 2 (Alexa 568) → dinocell_ch2.pt
- Channel 3-4 (Alexa 488) → dinocell_ch3-4.pt
- Channel 5 (Hoechst - nuclei) → dinocell_ch5.pt
- Brightfield → dinocell_brightfield.pt
```

**Total time**: 24-48hrs (pretrain) + 5×2hrs (fine-tune) = ~34-58hrs for ALL modalities!

**Alternative (More Advanced)**: Multi-view consistency
- Treat different channels as different "views" of same cell
- Use DINO's multi-crop strategy with different channels
- Model automatically learns channel-invariant features
- Requires modifying DINOv3 augmentation code (complex)

### Q4: How to configure for patch size 8?

**Answer: Already configured in `dinov3_vits8_jump_pretrain.yaml`**

**Key changes from patch-16**:

```yaml
student:
  patch_size: 8  # ← Changed from 16
  
crops:
  global_crops_size: 224  # Same size, but now 28×28=784 patches (vs 14×14=196)
  local_crops_size: 96   # Now 12×12=144 patches
  
train:
  batch_size_per_gpu: 48  # Lower than p16 due to more patches
```

**Impact**:
- 4x more computational cost (784 vs 196 patches)
- 4x higher resolution features
- Better for small cell features
- Still fits in 24-48hrs with ViT-S

## 📊 Configuration File Explained

### Critical Parameters (Already Set in Config)

```yaml
# ==== MOST IMPORTANT ====
student:
  arch: vit_small                    # ← Your model choice
  patch_size: 8                      # ← Your resolution requirement

# ==== STABILITY ====
compute_precision:
  param_dtype: bf16                  # ← Avoid NaN (NOT fp16!)
  
student:
  qkv_bias: true                     # ← If you get NaN, set to false
  
# ==== SSL LOSSES ====
gram:
  use_loss: false                    # ← Disabled (not for distilled models)
  
dino:
  loss_weight: 1.0                   # ← Main loss
  
ibot:
  loss_weight: 1.0                   # ← Masked prediction

```

### What Each Parameter Does

**Student Architecture**:
- `patch_size: 8`: Divides 224×224 into 28×28 patches (vs 14×14 for p16)
- `pretrained_weights`: Loads ViT-S/16, adapts to p8 automatically
- `drop_path_rate: 0.1`: Lower than from-scratch (0.3) for stability

**Optimization**:
- `lr: 5.0e-5`: 1/10 of from-scratch LR (key for not breaking pretrained features)
- `warmup_epochs: 10`: Shorter than from-scratch (30) since already trained
- `weight_decay: 0.04`: Standard L2 regularization

**Data**:
- `global_crops_scale: [0.4, 1.0]`: Larger minimum (0.4 vs 0.32) for cells
- `global_crops_size: 224`: Standard DINOv3 size
- `local_crops_number: 8`: Multi-crop for robustness

**Hardware**:
- `batch_size_per_gpu: 48`: Tuned for A100 with p8 (reduce if OOM)
- `checkpointing: false`: Disabled for speed on single GPU
- `compile: true`: PyTorch 2.0 compilation for speed

## 🔄 The Multi-Channel Training Loop

### How It Works

**During Pretraining** (24-48hrs):
```
For each field of view:
  Load: [ch1.tiff, ch2.tiff, ..., ch5.tiff]
       ↓
  Average: img = mean(channels)
       ↓
  CLAHE + RGB: img_rgb
       ↓
  DINOv3 SSL: Learn features
       ↓
  Result: Backbone understands "cells" in general
```

**During Fine-Tuning** (per channel):
```
For Channel 1 cells:
  Load: ch1 cells with distance maps
       ↓
  Use: JUMP-pretrained backbone (frozen)
       ↓
  Train: Distance map decoder
       ↓
  Result: Ch1-specific cell segmentation
  
Repeat for Ch2, Ch3, Ch4, Ch5, Brightfield
```

### Why This Works

1. **SSL Pretraining**: Learns general "cell patterns" across all channels
2. **Shared Features**: Same cells appear in all channels → consistent features
3. **Channel-Specific Heads**: Each channel's unique characteristics captured in decoder
4. **Best of Both**: General + specific = robust segmentation

## 💡 Key Insights from GitHub Community

### From the Discussions

1. **Continue Training Works** (@baldassarreFe):
   > "Yes, the smaller ViT models distilled from the 7B can be further trained"
   > "I recommend starting from the ViT-L configuration...1/10 of the LR"

2. **Domain-Specific Can Beat Generic** (@sehunfromdaegu):
   > "training from scratch with domain-specific dataset performed better"
   > BUT: This requires much longer training (weeks)

3. **Watch for NaN** (@multiple users):
   > "fp16 + self-attention causes nan loss"
   > "qkv_bias: false" helps with stability
   > Use bf16, not fp16!

4. **LR is Critical** (@marjanstoimchev, @afilt):
   > Lower LR for continued training
   > 1/10 of original is recommended starting point
   > Monitor and adjust if needed

### Applied to Your Case

✅ Using ViT-S (not ViT-L) because of time constraints  
✅ Continue from checkpoint with lr=5e-5 (1/10 of 5e-4)  
✅ Using bf16 (not fp16)  
✅ Disabled Gram loss (not needed for distilled model)  
✅ Monitoring for NaN with fallbacks configured

## 🎓 Understanding the Approach

### Why SSL Pretraining Helps DINOCell

**Standard DINOv3 (pretrained on Instagram images)**:
- Knows: cats, dogs, people, furniture, landscapes
- Doesn't know: cell boundaries, organelles, phase contrast artifacts

**JUMP-Pretrained DINOv3**:
- Knows: Everything from standard DINOv3
- PLUS: cell morphology, organelles, microscopy artifacts
- PLUS: multi-channel consistency (from averaging)
- PLUS: higher resolution (patch-8 vs patch-16)

**Result**: Better features for DINOCell's distance map decoder!

### The Self-Supervised Magic

**What DINOv3 SSL Does**:
1. **DINO Loss**: Match teacher-student on different crops
   - Learns: "This crop and that crop are the same cell"
   - Captures: Cell identity invariant to crops

2. **iBOT Loss**: Predict masked patches
   - Learns: "Fill in missing cell parts"
   - Captures: Cell structure and context

3. **KoLeo Loss**: Spread embeddings uniformly
   - Learns: "Don't collapse to same representation"
   - Captures: Cell diversity

**Together**: Model learns rich, robust cell representations without labels!

## 🎊 Final Recommendations

### For Your 24-48hr Timeline

**Use This Exact Configuration**:
1. ✅ Model: ViT-Small
2. ✅ Patch Size: 8
3. ✅ Strategy: Continue from checkpoint
4. ✅ LR: 5e-5 (1/10 original)
5. ✅ Epochs: 80
6. ✅ Batch Size: 48
7. ✅ Channel: Average fluorescent
8. ✅ Precision: bf16

**Launch With**:
```bash
cd DINOCell/training
./launch_pretraining.sh
```

**Monitor For**:
- ✅ Steady loss decrease
- ✅ No NaN (if you get NaN, see troubleshooting)
- ✅ ~1500 iterations/hour
- ✅ Checkpoints every ~2.5 hours

**If You Need to Adjust**:
- OOM → Reduce batch_size to 32
- NaN → Set qkv_bias: false or use fp32
- Too slow → Increase batch_size to 64 (if memory allows)
- Want faster → Reduce epochs to 60

---

## 🌟 Bonus: Multi-View Future Work

After you validate that this works, consider:

**Multi-View SSL** (Advanced):
```python
# Modify DINO to use different channels as views
global_crop_1 = avg(ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4, ch5)  # Average
global_crop_2 = random_choice([ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4, ch5])  # Single

# DINO enforces: global_crop_1 ≈ global_crop_2
# Result: Channel-invariant features!
```

This is cutting-edge and could be a significant contribution!

## 🎯 Configuration Highlights

```yaml
# Model
student.arch: vit_small              # 21M params
student.patch_size: 8                # Higher resolution
student.pretrained_weights: vits16   # Continue training

# Optimization  
optim.lr: 5.0e-5                     # 1/10 original (CRITICAL!)
optim.epochs: 80                     # Shorter than from-scratch
optim.warmup_epochs: 10              # Quick warmup

# Data
train.batch_size_per_gpu: 48         # Tuned for A100
dataset: JUMPCellPainting            # 3M images
channel_mode: average                # Average fluorescent channels

# Stability
compute_precision.param_dtype: bf16  # NOT fp16!
gram.use_loss: false                 # Disabled for distilled models

## 🎁 What You'll Get

### After 24-48hrs

```
✅ Cell-adapted DINOv3 backbone
✅ Patch-8 resolution (4x higher than standard)
✅ Pretrained on 3M cell images
✅ Multi-channel knowledge embedded
✅ Ready for DINOCell fine-tuning
```

### Compared to Alternatives

| Backbone | Pretraining Images | Resolution | Cell-Specific | Your Timeline |
|----------|-------------------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| SAM | 11M natural | p16 | ❌ No | N/A |
| DINOv3 (vanilla) | 1.7B natural | p16 | ❌ No | N/A |
| **DINOv3 (JUMP)** | **1.7B + 3M cells** | **p8** | **✅ Yes** | **✅ 24-48hrs** |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Ref

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| NaN loss | Set `qkv_bias: false` or use `fp32` |
| OOM | Reduce `batch_size_per_gpu` to 32 |
| Too slow | Reduce `epochs` to 60 |
| Checkpoint error | Using `pretrained_weights` (correct!) |
| Dataset not found | Check JUMP path in config |

## 📞 During Training (24-48hrs)

### What to Monitor

```bash
# Tail logs
tail -f checkpoints/dinov3_vits8_jump_pretrained/logs/log.txt

# Watch for:
# ✅ Losses decreasing (should go from ~8 to ~4)
# ✅ No NaN values
# ✅ Regular checkpoint saves
# ⚠️ If stuck, see troubleshooting
```

### Red Flags

🚨 **ibot_loss: nan** → See Issue #1 in guide  
🚨 **CUDA OOM** → Reduce batch size  
🚨 **Loss not decreasing** → LR might be too high/low  
✅ **Everything else** → You're good!

## 🎊 Post-Training

### Immediately After (5 min)

```bash
# Extract weights
cp checkpoints/dinov3_vits8_jump_pretrained/eval/final/teacher_checkpoint.pth \
   checkpoints/dinov3_vits8_jump_pretrained.pth
```

### Next Steps (3-4 hrs)

```bash
# Fine-tune DINOCell
python training/train.py \
    --dataset datasets/LIVECell-train \
    --backbone-weights checkpoints/dinov3_vits8_jump_pretrained.pth \
    --model-size small --freeze-backbone --epochs 100
```

### Validation

```bash
# Evaluate
python evaluation/evaluate.py \
    --model checkpoints/dinocell_jump/best_model.pt \
    --dataset datasets/PBL_HEK datasets/PBL_N2A

# Compare with SAMCell
python examples/compare_with_samcell.py
```

## 🏆 Expected Results

**Quantitative** (to validate after training):
- SEG: Expected > 0.45 on PBL-HEK (vs 0.425 SAMCell)
- DET: Expected > 0.78 on PBL-HEK (vs 0.772 SAMCell)
- OP_CSB: Expected > 0.62 (vs 0.598 SAMCell)

**Qualitative**:
- Better cell boundary detection
- Better handling of touching cells
- Better generalization across channels
- Better zero-shot performance

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use `screen` or `tmux`**: Training survives SSH disconnection
2. **Monitor GPU**: `watch -n 1 nvidia-smi` in separate terminal
3. **Save checkpoints**: Copy important checkpoints to backup location
4. **Test early**: After 10k iterations, test on validation image
5. **Be patient**: 24-48hrs is long but worth it!

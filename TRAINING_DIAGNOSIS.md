   - Loss stable: 18.52 ‚Üí 18.39
   - No NaN values
   - Gradients healthy (800-1200 range)

3. **Wandb Logging:** ‚úÖ
   - Online mode active
   - URL: https://wandb.ai/saahilsanganeria666-georgia-institute-of-technology/dinocell-ssl-pretraining/runs/id8p2bml

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Issues Found

1. **GPU Underutilized**
   - Memory: 33GB/82GB used (only 40%!)
   - Batch size: 40 (too small)
   - **Fix:** Increased to 80

2. **Slow Iteration Speed**
   - Time per iteration: 5-10 seconds
   - Data loading: 4-8 seconds (S3 latency)
   - ETA: 8-9 days (too long!)
   - **Expected with batch_size=80:** ~1.5-2 days

3. **Attention Maps Not Visible Yet**
   - Config: attention_log_interval = 1000
   - Current iteration: 40
   - **Reason:** Won't appear until iteration 1000!
   - **Fix:** Changed to 100 for faster visibility

## üîß Optimizations Applied

### 1. Increased Batch Size
**Before:**
```yaml
batch_size_per_gpu: 40  # Using 33GB/82GB
```

**After:**
```yaml
batch_size_per_gpu: 80  # Better GPU utilization
```

**Expected impact:**
- GPU memory: 33GB ‚Üí ~60-65GB (75-80% utilization)
- Iterations/hour: ~360 ‚Üí ~500-600
- ETA: 8 days ‚Üí **1.5-2 days** ‚úÖ
- Convergence: Similar or better (larger batch = more stable gradients)

### 2. Increased Attention Logging Frequency
**Before:**
```yaml
attention_log_interval: 1000  # First attention at iteration 1000
```

**After:**
```yaml
attention_log_interval: 100  # First attention at iteration 100
```

**Expected impact:**
- See attention maps in ~20-30 minutes instead of ~3-4 hours
- More frequent monitoring (every 100 iterations)
- Better visibility into model learning

## üîç Current Status (Iteration 40 Analysis)

### Training Metrics
```python
iteration: 40
loss: 18.39  # Stable, good starting point
dino_loss: 11.11  # Standard for early training
ibot_loss: 5.55  # Healthy
koleo_loss: 8.63  # Feature diversity
gradient_norm: 881  # Good, not exploding
```

### GPU Stats
```
Memory: 33GB/82GB (40% - UNDERUTILIZED)
Utilization: 0% during data loading, ~80% during forward/backward
Power: 61W (low because of data loading wait)
Temperature: 35¬∞C (cool)
```

### Data Loading
```
Time per iteration: 5.2s total
  - Data loading: 4.9s (S3 streaming)
  - Computation: 0.3s
  
Issue: Data loading dominates! 
Batch size 80 won't significantly increase data load time
‚Üí Better amortization of S3 latency
```

## ‚ö° Why Batch Size 80 is Safe

### Memory Analysis

**Current (bs=40):**
```
Peak memory: 30.9GB (from logs)
Total allocated: 33.3GB (from nvidia-smi)
Headroom: 48.7GB unused
```

**Estimated (bs=80):**
```
Model weights: ~12GB (fixed)
Optimizer states: ~12GB (fixed)
Activations (linear scaling): 30.9GB √ó 2 = ~62GB
Total: ~62-65GB
Headroom: ~17-20GB (safe margin)
```

**Conclusion:** 80 is safe, could even go to 90-100!

### Why Not Higher?

Keeping some headroom for:
- FSDP communication buffers
- S3 cache (1000 images)
- Gradient accumulation
- PyTorch memory spikes

80 is a good sweet spot: **2x performance, still safe**

## üêõ Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

### 1. S3 SSL Error (line 742)
```
Failed to load: [SSL: WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER]
```
**Diagnosis:** One corrupted file in S3 bucket  
**Impact:** None - dataset has 19,584 fields, one bad file is fine  
**Action:** None needed, training continues  

### 2. TF32 Warning (line 743)
```
UserWarning: Please use the new API settings...
```
**Diagnosis:** PyTorch 2.9 deprecation notice  
**Impact:** None - still works, just warning about future API  
**Action:** Can ignore, or update if annoying  

### 3. Attention Map Error (from test)
```
Failed to log attention maps: 'FSDPDinoVisionTransformer' object has no attribute 'get_last_selfattention'
```
**Diagnosis:** FSDP wrapping hides the method  
**Status:** Fix applied (unwrap FSDP before calling)  
**Will verify:** At iteration 100 with new run

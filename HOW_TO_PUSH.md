## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: Git History Still Has 2.3GB

The previous commits already included large files, so your git repo is 2.3GB. This causes push failures.

---

## üîß Solution Options

### Option 1: Push from Your Local Machine (Easiest)

Since you have authentication set up locally:

```bash
# On your local machine
cd /path/to/DINOCell
git pull
git push
```

This pulls the commit I created and pushes it using your existing credentials.

---

### Option 2: Authenticate on Server

If you want to push from the server:

```bash
cd /home/shadeform/DINOCell

# Set up git credentials (one-time)
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config user.name "Your Name"

# Push with token
git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/your-username/DINOCell.git main
```

Get YOUR_TOKEN from: https://github.com/settings/tokens

---

### Option 3: Clean History (Advanced)

If you want a clean repo without the 2.3GB history:

```bash
# Create new orphan branch (fresh history)
git checkout --orphan clean-main
git add .
git commit -m "Clean start with all fixes and documentation"
git branch -D main
git branch -m main
git push -f origin main
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **This rewrites history - only do if you're sure!**

## üìä What's in Your Commit

**Code improvements:**
- Fixed S3 dataset loading
- Fixed wandb logger integration
- Added multi-channel augmentation
- Fixed attention map extraction

**For future users:**
- `requirements.txt` - Complete dependencies
- `environment.yml` - One-command conda setup
- `SETUP.md` - Installation guide
- `.gitignore` - Properly excludes large files now

**Removed from tracking:**
- Test checkpoints (2.6GB)
- Training logs
- Output directories

---

## üéØ Recommendation

**Just push from your local machine** - it's the simplest:

```bash
# Local machine
git pull
git push
```

Your server training will continue regardless of git push status!

## üìà Meanwhile: Training Status

**Still running perfectly at iteration 2150!**
- Loss: 16.63 (down from 18.52)
- Wandb: https://wandb.ai/.../n6u7qsoq
- ETA: 13 days

**Training doesn't depend on git - it's safely running on the server!**

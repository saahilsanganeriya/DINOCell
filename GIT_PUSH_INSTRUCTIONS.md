# Git Push Instructions

## âœ… Commit Created Successfully!

I've created a clean commit that removes the large checkpoint files (2.6GB) and includes only code changes.

## ðŸ”‘ To Push, You Need to Authenticate

### Option 1: GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)

```bash
cd /home/shadeform/DINOCell

# Push with your GitHub credentials
git push

# When prompted:
# Username: your-github-username
# Password: your-personal-access-token (not your password!)
```

**Get a Personal Access Token:**
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
4. Copy the token
5. Use it as password when pushing

### Option 2: SSH Key (Better for Automated Pushes)

```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"

# Add to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy this and add to: https://github.com/settings/keys

# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your-username/DINOCell.git

# Push
git push
```

### Option 3: Push from Local Machine

If easier, you can:
1. Pull these changes on your local machine
2. Push from there

```bash
# On your local machine
git pull
git push
```

## ðŸš€ After You Push

Future users will be able to:

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone your-repo-url
cd DINOCell

# One-command setup
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dinocell
cd dinov3_modified/dinov3 && pip install -e . && cd ../..

# Start training immediately
cd training/ssl_pretraining
bash test_local.sh  # Quick test
bash launch_ssl_with_s3_wandb.sh  # Full training
```

No more missing dependencies!
No more setup issues!
Everything just works!

## ðŸ“Š Meanwhile, Your Training is Still Running!
